            <p>
              I'm an aspiring <strong>Software Engineer</strong>, a
              <strong>designer</strong>, and a <strong>developer</strong>
              constantly working to build new skills and hone my existing ones.
              <em>I currently live in Kigali, Rwanda</em>

            <p>
              I have experienced various types of work and have easily adapted
              to all the tasks I've undertaken over the years. I've enjoyed each
              of them, but nothing feels as fulfilling as this. I have a deep
              passion for my work and hope to cultivate that passion into a
              career that brings me joy and fulfillment. Being a software
              engineer is something I love, and I aspire to inspire as many
              people as possible.
